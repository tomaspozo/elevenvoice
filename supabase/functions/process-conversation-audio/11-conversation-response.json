Dave is from Switzerland and speaks English and Swedish. He expresses a dislike for hobbies, reading, and watching movies or TV shows. However, he enjoys classical music and has been playing the flute for almost 20 years.\n\nDave prefers cold weather and mountains over beaches, citing his discomfort with heat. He's a morning person, waking up at 5 am daily, and enjoys starting his day with coffee and homemade cookies. Winter is his favorite season, appreciating that people wear more clothing during this time.\n\nDave mentions liking train travel and recalls an interesting trip to London. Throughout the conversation, Dave's responses are often brief and direct, sometimes expressing strong preferences or dislikes.\n\nThe agent asks a series of questions to gather information and create a voice profile. The conversation concludes with the agent thanking Dave for the information and stating that they have everything needed to create the voice sample. The call ends after Dave says goodbye."
